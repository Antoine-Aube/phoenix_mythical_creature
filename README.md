As you work through this exercise, you will gain a deeper understanding of Ruby programming and Test-Driven Development (TDD) while immersing yourself in the rich culture of one of the world's most intriguing civilizations. Inspired by the [mythical_creatures](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod-1-be-exercises/tree/main/ruby_exercises/mythical-creatures) collection of exercises created by the [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.edu/), this is a great way to expand your skills and learn about the ancient world!
